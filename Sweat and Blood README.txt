The heart rate (RR) and electrodermal activity (EDA) data that we will analyze in this 
paper was collected while 74 participants watched 4 movie trailers/advertisements (Fault in Our 
Stars, Entourage, Get Hard, Victoria’s Secret) on 2 platforms (computer monitor and mobile 
phone) in a within-subject study. In addition to collecting physiological data, participants were 
also asked to fill a pre-experiment and post-experiment survey. The pre-experiment survey 
included questions about the participant’s personalities and moods, while the post-experiment 
survey attempted to get at how participants felt about the movie trailer/advertisements. The goal 
of this paper is to design reproducible methods to efficiently analyze this physiological and 
survey data.
